=== PROJECT 1 - My Personal Profile Page ===

Description:
For your first project, youâ€™ll practice web design skills by customizing a web page to create a personal profile. You'll modify the code for a basic web page by adding graphics, custom text, and a stylish design. This is a great way for you to practice HTML and CSS skills. It also gives you a web page you can use as a personal online calling card to advertise your experience, skills, and goals, and to provide links to your social media accounts on Twitter, LinkedIn and GitHub.
