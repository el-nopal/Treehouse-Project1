Project Instructions:
Create or find an image file to represent yourself and a new image for the background. Be aware of file size: keep the profile image under 400 KB and the background image under 1 MB (see the link in the project resources section to Picresize, an online image resizing tool).
Using a text editor, modify the HTML of the index.html file:

Add the images you collected in step 1 to the page. Please leave the class "profile-image" intact on your profile image.
Don't forget to update the text for your new profile image's alt attribute!

Personalize all the text on the page by changing the name, background and goals. Feel free to make up the information if you do not wish to share anything personal.
Add links to your GitHub, Twitter and LinkedIn accounts. If you don't have a Twitter or LinkedIn account, or don't want to share those, then you need to delete those links.
Edit the href value of the Home link so it navigates to index.html. Note: do not use root relative links, or links that begin with a leading forward slash, /.
Feel free to expand on this project, by adding an additional page or two, adding more images and customizing the CSS.
If you do not want to add an additional page then delete the experience link in the HTML.
